# Dice Roll Game

## Overview

This is a simple dice rolling game implemented in Python. The main purpose of this program is to demonstrate basic programming skills such as using functions, loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and random number generation.

## Skills Demonstrated

1. **Function Definition**: The program defines a function `dice_roll` to encapsulate the game's logic.
2. **Loops**: Utilizes a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they decide to quit.
3. **Conditional Statements**: Uses `if-elif-else` statements to handle different user inputs.
4. **User Input Handling**: Demonstrates how to capture and process user input.
5. **Random Number Generation**: Employs the `random.randint` function to simulate rolling a six-sided die.
6. **String Methods**: Uses the `lower()` method to ensure the user's input is case-insensitive.

## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code below into a Python file, for example `dice_roll.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the `dice_roll.py` file.
5. Run the program by typing `python dice_roll.py`.
